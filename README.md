# Institutional Web3 Infrastructure

> **SANDBOX / EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY — NOT FOR PRODUCTION**
> This codebase is a reference implementation designed for learning, prototyping, and architectural exploration. It is **not audited, not legally reviewed, and must not be used to custody real funds, manage real private keys, or process real financial transactions.** See the [Production Warning](#production-warning) section for full details.

Enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure layer providing a custody-grade double-entry ledger (append-only, hash-chained, serializable isolation), Ethereum L1 integration (block indexing, reorg detection, finality tracking), wallet management with HSM/MPC signing pipelines, event-driven architecture via transactional outbox → Kafka with dead-letter queues, institutional controls (IAM, governance, compliance, risk management), settlement & clearing (DvP/PvP/netting), lending/margin/liquidation engine, FX conversion, price oracle, treasury management, and comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus metrics export. All financial operations enforce ACID guarantees with database-level immutability triggers, DB-enforced state machine transitions, cryptographic audit trails, and automated reconciliation.

This system implements the **core backend infrastructure** of a digital-asset custody platform — the kind of system that underpins institutional custodians (BitGo, Fireblocks, Anchorage), crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken), and fintech platforms building crypto-native banking products.

## What This Does

### 1. Custody-Grade Financial Ledger

- **Double-entry accounting** — every transfer creates balanced debit + credit entries

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- An Ethereum RPC endpoint (Infura, Alchemy, or local node)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavondunbar/Institutional-Web3-Infrastructure.git
cd Institutional-Web3-Infrastructure

docker compose up -d
npm install
psql -h localhost -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE tradfi_web3;"
npm run migrate
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d tradfi_web3 -c "GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON outbox TO ledger_writer;"

# Fork Ethereum Mainnet (separate terminal)
anvil --fork-url [YOUR_RPC_URL] --chain-id 1337 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8545

npm run dev
```

### Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}

curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
# Prometheus text format metrics
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # 64 tests across 4 suites
npx jest --coverage   # With coverage report
```

Test suites:
- **Ledger service** — balanced posting, hash chain, idempotency, reversals, double-spend prevention
- **Wallet service** — creation, nonce allocation, reorg handling, concurrency
- **Institutional services** — key management, settlement, treasury, monitoring, lending, FX, privacy, infrastructure, trust domains, asset lifecycle, vendor risk
- **Integration tests** — end-to-end API flows covering custody, clearing, stablecoin, DeFi, bonds, ETF, funds, unbanked, disaster recovery, and zero-trust

## Failure Scenarios

### Chain Reorganization (Reorg) Handling

```
Block Indexer polls block N+1
  → Fetches block.parentHash
  → Compares against stored hash for block N
  → MISMATCH → reorg triggered → marks affected data → re-indexes from fork point
```

### Double-Spend Prevention

Three layers: application validation → `SELECT FOR UPDATE` row locking → serializable isolation (SSI conflict detection). It is physically impossible for two conflicting transactions to both commit.

### DB-Enforced State Machine Transitions

```sql
-- Example: transactions_blockchain can only go:
-- pending → signing/failed
-- signing → submitted/failed
-- submitted → confirmed/failed/reorged
-- confirmed → reorged (only)
-- failed/reorged → (terminal, no transitions)

CREATE TRIGGER trg_tx_state_machine
  BEFORE UPDATE OF status ON transactions_blockchain
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION enforce_tx_state_machine();
```

Similar triggers enforce valid transitions on `settlement_instructions`, `loans`, and `approval_requests`.

### Dead Letter Queue Recovery

```
Outbox publish fails → Message sent to DLQ table + Kafka DLQ topic
  → Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
  → After 5 retries: status = 'exhausted' (requires manual intervention)
  → Manual reprocess via POST /api/v1/institutional/dlq/:id/reprocess
```

## Production Warning

**This project is explicitly NOT suitable for production use.** It is a reference implementation for learning and architectural exploration. Critical missing components include:

- Real HSM/MPC cryptographic integration (signing is stubbed)
- TLS termination & mutual authentication
- Network segmentation & firewalling
- Security audit & penetration testing
- Backup & disaster recovery procedures
- Regulatory compliance (BitLicense, MiCA, MTL)
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 certification
- Production monitoring (PagerDuty, Datadog)
- Multi-region deployment
- Insurance coverage

> **Do not use this code to custody, manage, or transfer real digital assets or funds.**
