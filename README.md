# Blockchain Custody Infrastructure

> **SANDBOX / EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY — NOT FOR PRODUCTION**
> This codebase is a reference implementation designed for learning, prototyping, and architectural exploration. It is **not audited, not legally reviewed, and must not be used to custody real funds, manage real private keys, or process real financial transactions.** See the [Production Warning](#production-warning) section for full details.

Enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure layer providing a custody-grade double-entry ledger (append-only, hash-chained, serializable isolation), Ethereum L1 integration (block indexing, reorg detection, finality tracking), wallet management with HSM/MPC signing pipelines, and event-driven architecture via transactional outbox → Kafka. All financial operations enforce ACID guarantees with database-level immutability triggers, cryptographic audit trails, and automated reconciliation.

This system implements the **core backend infrastructure** of a digital-asset custody platform — the kind of system that underpins institutional custodians (BitGo, Fireblocks, Anchorage), crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken), and fintech platforms building crypto-native banking products.

It handles the full operational lifecycle: custody-grade financial accounting, blockchain transaction creation and monitoring, wallet key management orchestration, chain event indexing with reorg resilience, and automated integrity verification — all through an event-driven architecture that guarantees no state change is ever lost.

## What This Does

### 1. Custody-Grade Financial Ledger

Every movement of funds is recorded as a balanced debit/credit pair in an immutable, hash-chained ledger. You cannot lose track of where money is, you cannot edit history, and you can cryptographically prove the records haven't been tampered with.

- **Double-entry accounting** — every transfer creates balanced debit + credit entries
- **Hash-chained audit trail** — SHA-256 chain links every entry to its predecessor
- **Append-only enforcement** — database triggers physically prevent UPDATE/DELETE on ledger rows
- **Serializable isolation** — the strongest ACID guarantee Postgres offers
- **Idempotency keys** — duplicate requests are safely deduplicated
- **Explicit reversals** — corrections are new mirror entries, never mutations

### 2. Ethereum L1 Integration

The system connects to Ethereum, watches for new blocks and events, submits signed transactions, tracks confirmation and finality, and handles chain-level edge cases that can cause fund loss if ignored.

- **Block-by-block indexing** — continuous ingestion of blocks and contract events
- **Reorg detection and recovery** — detects chain forks by verifying parent hash continuity, marks affected data, and re-indexes from the fork point
- **Finality tracking** — configurable confirmation threshold (default 12 blocks) distinguishing "confirmed" from "finalized"
- **Gas estimation** — EIP-1559 aware fee calculation
- **Stuck transaction detection** — alerts when submitted transactions haven't confirmed after 15 minutes

### 3. Wallet & Signing Pipeline

Manages blockchain wallets and orchestrates the transaction signing workflow, separating protocol logic from security controls.

- **Wallet lifecycle** — create, classify (hot/warm/cold/deposit), and monitor wallets
- **Transaction pipeline** — create → sign → submit → monitor → confirm
- **Nonce management** — Redis atomic increment prevents nonce collisions under concurrency
- **KMS/HSM integration interface** — pluggable signing service (local dev signer for testing, production uses MPC/HSM)
- **Reorg handling** — marks affected transactions when chain reorganizations occur

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture

Every state change is guaranteed to reach downstream systems through the transactional outbox pattern.

- **Transactional outbox** — events are written to the outbox table in the same database transaction as the state change
- **Kafka publishing** — a relay service polls unpublished events and delivers them to Kafka topics
- **At-least-once delivery** — guaranteed delivery; consumers must be idempotent
- **FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED** — concurrent-safe polling without blocking

### 5. Automated Reconciliation

Scheduled jobs independently verify system integrity without relying on application-layer correctness.

- **Balance reconciliation** — compares cached balances against reconstructed-from-ledger balances every 5 minutes
- **Hash chain verification** — walks every account's entry chain checking for broken links every 15 minutes
- **Alert on failure** — emits events to Kafka when discrepancies are detected

## Who This Benefits

### Institutional Clients

| Need | How This Addresses It |
|------|----------------------|
| **Regulatory audit trail** | Every fund movement is recorded in a hash-chained, append-only ledger with external reference traceability. The entire history can be reconstructed from raw entries. |
| **Counterparty risk elimination** | Serializable isolation + row-level locking ensures no double-spend, no race conditions, and no phantom reads — even under high concurrency. |
| **Operational resilience** | Reorg detection prevents silent fund loss from chain reorganizations. Stuck transaction detection prevents capital lockup. Circuit-breaker patterns prevent cascading RPC failures. |
| **Separation of duties** | Database-enforced least-privilege roles (reader vs. writer) ensure that read-only services cannot mutate ledger data at the infrastructure level. |
| **Multi-system integration** | The Kafka event bus allows compliance, reporting, notifications, and analytics systems to react to every state change without coupling to the core. |
| **Disaster recovery** | The append-only ledger + hash chain enables point-in-time reconstruction and cross-system reconciliation. |

### Retail Platforms

| Need | How This Addresses It |
|------|----------------------|
| **Correct balances at scale** | The balance cache provides O(1) lookups while the ledger provides provably correct derived balances. Reconciliation jobs catch any drift. |
| **Fast transaction processing** | Redis-backed nonce management and concurrent-safe ledger posting allow high-throughput transaction submission. |
| **Real-time event streaming** | Kafka events enable real-time notifications, portfolio updates, and activity feeds for end users. |
| **Multi-chain readiness** | The architecture cleanly separates chain-specific logic (adapters) from business logic (ledger, wallets). Adding new chains requires only a new adapter. |
| **Uptime under chain instability** | Reorg handling, stuck tx detection, and automated reconciliation mean the platform stays correct even when the underlying chain misbehaves. |

### Data Flow

1. **API request** → Express validates and routes to the appropriate service
2. **Ledger posting** → Serializable transaction writes journal entry + ledger entries + balance cache update + outbox event — all atomically
3. **Outbox relay** → Background process polls unpublished events and delivers to Kafka
4. **Block indexer** → Continuously ingests blocks, stores events, detects reorgs
5. **Chain service** → Monitors submitted transactions, tracks confirmations, detects stuck txs
6. **Reconciliation** → Cron jobs verify balance integrity and hash chain continuity

## Core Components

### Ledger Service (`src/database/ledger-service.ts`)

The heart of the system. Posts double-entry journal entries with hash chaining, serializable isolation, idempotency, and atomic outbox writes. Supports explicit reversals for corrections.

### Wallet Service (`src/wallet/wallet-service.ts`)

Manages wallet registration, transaction creation (with Redis-backed atomic nonce allocation), lifecycle tracking (pending → signing → submitted → confirmed → failed → reorged), and reorg handling.

### Block Indexer (`src/indexer/block-indexer.ts`)

Continuously polls Ethereum for new blocks. Stores block metadata and contract events. Detects reorgs by verifying parent hash continuity. On reorg detection: marks affected blocks/events/transactions, resets to fork point, emits alert events.

### Chain Service (`src/chain/chain-service.ts`)

Handles transaction submission, gas estimation (EIP-1559), finality tracking with configurable confirmation threshold, and stuck transaction detection with alerting.

### Outbox Relay (`src/messaging/outbox-relay.ts`)

Polls the transactional outbox table using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrent safety. Publishes to Kafka with an idempotent producer. Marks entries as published after successful delivery.

### Redis Cache (`src/cache/redis.ts`)

Provides balance caching (TTL-based read-through), atomic nonce management, sliding-window rate limiting, block height tracking, and transaction status caching.

### Reconciliation Service (`src/reconciliation/reconciliation-service.ts`)

Cron-scheduled jobs that verify:
- **Balance integrity** — cached balances match independently reconstructed balances from raw ledger entries
- **Hash chain integrity** — no broken links, no sequence gaps in the cryptographic chain

Emits Kafka events on failures for downstream alerting.

### API Layer (`src/api/app.ts`)

REST endpoints for:
- Posting journal entries and reversals
- Querying account balances and transaction history
- Creating wallets and submitting blockchain transactions
- Querying chain state, blocks, and indexed events
- Viewing reconciliation run history

## Production Warning

**This project is explicitly NOT suitable for production use.** Blockchain custody infrastructure is among the most security-sensitive systems in financial technology. The following critical components are absent or require hardening:

| Missing Component | Risk if Absent |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration | Private keys stored in software are vulnerable to extraction |
| Real MPC threshold signing (FROST / GG20) | Single-point-of-failure key management |
| TLS termination & mutual authentication | Unencrypted service-to-service communication |
| Network segmentation & firewalling | Services reachable from unauthorized networks |
| Security audit & penetration testing | Unknown vulnerabilities in application logic |
| Backup & disaster recovery procedures | Data loss on hardware failure |
| Regulatory compliance (BitLicense, MiCA, state MTL) | Legal liability for operating without licenses |
| SOC 2 / ISO 27001 controls | No formal security controls framework |
| Production monitoring & alerting (PagerDuty, Datadog) | Incidents go undetected |
| Key ceremony & rotation procedures | Long-lived keys increase compromise window |
| Rate limiting & DDoS protection | API abuse and resource exhaustion |
| Input validation hardening | Injection and malformed data attacks |
| Multi-region deployment & failover | Single point of failure at infrastructure level |

> Building a production custody platform requires: licensed money transmission or e-money status, HSM or MPC infrastructure with certified key management, hot/cold wallet segregation, multi-signature approval workflows, real-time chain monitoring, regulatory compliance programs, SOC 2 Type II certification, incident response procedures, and insurance coverage. **Do not use this code to custody, manage, or transfer real digital assets or funds.**
